## Why HomeGenie?

We can see bunch of new smart devices brought to the market everyday,
each of them implementing proprietary protocols and applications.
So dealing with your smart devices it often means dealing with
different applications making home automation not that effective.

This is why *HomeGenie* server was specifically designed to find a reasonable
good way of integrating current and future home automation technologies into
one single piece of software.
