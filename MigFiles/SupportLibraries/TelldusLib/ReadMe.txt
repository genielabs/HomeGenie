This is a port/rewrite of the tellstick library used by http://www.switchking.se/ so creds should go out to henkep http://www.switchking.se/forum/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=900
The plan is a complete rewrite to get rid of those nasty if's used in the pinvoke-wrapper and simplify the eventhandling.

It depends on the telldustools being installed since it invokes that lib.
